Media Keys Within An Auto Hot Key Script

If you don't have media keys upon your keyboard and would like to be able to control your audio whilst in another programme,
then you've come to the right place!

First of all, download and install AutoHotkey on your computer, which is straightforward.

Then go ahead and run Media_Keys.ahk

The new control key combinations are:
Ctrl + Alt + Left : Previous
Ctrl + Alt + Right : Next
Ctrl + Alt + Down : Play/Pause
Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Left : Volume Down
Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Right: Volume Up
Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Down : Mute/Unmute

To make it run on every start, right-click on the script file you created and Compile Script,
which creates an executable file that you can place into the startup folder.

The path to the Startup folder is as follows: %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
